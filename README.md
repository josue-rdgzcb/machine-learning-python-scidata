# Machine Learning with Python – Scidata Diploma

This repository contains my personal notes, assignments, and notebooks from the Machine Learning with Python diploma program offered by Scidata (September 22 – November 04). Each module is documented with tasks, notebooks, and notes that reflect both technical development and learning milestones.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Record my progress throughout the Machine Learning with Python diploma offered by Scidata
- Document key concepts and workflows in machine learning
- Apply models using Python libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)

2. **Preprocessing and Pipelines** – Train/test split, encoding, missing values, scaling, preprocessing pipelines  
3. **Dimensionality Reduction** – PCA, autoencoders, optimization  
4. **Supervised Models** – Regression, KNN, decision trees, SVM  
5. **Unsupervised Models** – K-means, DBScan, clustering, dimensionality reduction  
6. **Ensemble Methods** – Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting  
7. **Optimization and Automation** – Advanced pipelines, GridSearch, cross-validation
